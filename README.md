# Divergence_Capstone
Data Science Capstone

Vision statement:

As my final project for the Divergence Data Science program I will synthesize the various theories and techniques for modeling and scaling. I will gather pertinent datasets, wrangle and clean its data points before designing a proper model shema for data exploration and analytics. I will use SQL techniques to engineer the data for visualization and culminate the project with machine learning.
